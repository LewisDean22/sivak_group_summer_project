# Colloidal Information Engine Project:

## Contents

* Initialise project directory
* Cython setup 
* Model constants 
* Ensemble generator 
* Power calculator 
* Analysis scripts
* Data plotter 
* Power Spectral density calculator
* Cluster computing

<p>
Have docstrings on all functions but refer to readme file at the top of each separate script for a script summary.
</p>
<p>
Also, use draw.io to make a diagram which will be used in lab book, report, and this readme file to be seen in the Git repository.
</p>
<p>
May be important to check out the GitHub environment tab such that the compute Canada virtual environment works for othersï¿½
</p>
